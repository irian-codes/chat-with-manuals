      '7.8.3 Commander. Loyal Viziers begin on Move and Battle. In battle as attacker, you deal an extra hit. 7.8.4 Despot. Loyal Viziers begin on Move and Build. Whenever you remove at least one enemy building or token in battle, you score one extra victory point (two in total, 3.2.1). 8. Woodland Alliance A A 8.1 Overview The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various creatures of the Woodland who are dissatisfied with their present condition. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a base. Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military flexibility. 8.2 Faction Rules and Abilities 8.2.1 Crafting. The Alliance crafts during Daylight by activating sympathy tokens. 8.2.2 Guerrilla War. As defender in battle, the Alliance will deal hits equal to the higher roll, and the attacker will deal hits equal to the lower roll. 8.2.3 The Supporters Stack. To take various actions, the Alliance spends supporters, which are cards on their Supporters stack. Supporters can only be spent for their suit and do not count against the Alliance’s hand size. Supporters are face down, but the Alliance may inspect them at any time. I Capacity. If the Alliance has no bases on the map, the Supporters stack can only hold up to five cards. If the Alliance would gain a supporter but the stack cannot hold it, that card is discarded. If any bases are on the map, the Supporters stack can hold unlimited cards. 8.2.4 Removing Bases. Whenever a base is removed, the Alliance must discard all supporters matching the printed suit of the base (including birds) and remove half of their officers, rounded up. If the Alliance has no more bases on the map and has more than five supporters, they must discard down to five supporters. 8.2.5 Sympathy Tokens. The Alliance has 10 sympathy tokens. I Placement Limits. A clearing can hold only one sympathy token. II Terms. A sympathetic clearing is one with a sympathy token. An unsympathetic clearing is one without a sympathy token. 8.2.6 Outrage. Whenever another player removes a sympathy token or moves any warriors into a sympathetic clearing, they must add one card matching the affected clearing from their hand to the 7 Supporters stack. If they have no matching cards (including no birds), they must show their hand to the Alliance, and then the Alliance draws a card from the deck and adds it to the Supporters stack. 8.3 Faction Setup 8.3.1 Step 1: Gather Warriors. Form a supply of 10 warriors. 8.3.2 Step 2: Place Bases. Place 3 bases on the matching spaces in your Bases box. 8.3.3 Step 3: Fill Sympathy Track. Place 10 sympathy tokens on your Sympathy track. 8.3.4 Step 4: Gain Supporters. Draw 3 cards and place them face down on your Supporters stack. 8.4 Birdsong Your Birdsong has two steps in the following order. 8.4.1 Revolt. Any number of times, you may take the Revolt action, as follows. I Step 1: Choose Clearing. Choose a sympathetic clearing that matches a base on your faction board. II Step 2: Spend Supporters. Spend two supporters matching the suit of the chosen clearing. III Step 3: Resolve Effect. Remove all enemy pieces from the chosen clearing. Then, place the matching base there, and place warriors there equal to the number of sympathetic clearings matching the base’s printed suit. Finally, place one warrior in the Officers box. This warrior is now an officer. (Remember to score one victory point per token and building removed.) 8.4.2 Spread Sympathy. Any number of times, you may take the Spread Sympathy action, as follows. I Step 1: Choose Clearing. Choose an unsympathetic clearing adjacent to a sympathetic clearing. If there are no sympathetic clearings, you may choose any clearing. II Step 2: Spend Supporters. Spend supporters matching the suit of the chosen clearing. The number of supporters that must be spent is listed above the sympathy token. a Martial Law. You must spend another matching supporter if the target clearing has at least 3 warriors of another player, including warriors they are treating as their own for rule (Mercenaries, hirelings, etc.). III Step 3: Place and Score. Place a sympathy token in the chosen clearing. Score the victory points on the space uncovered on your faction board. 8.5 Daylight You may take the following actions in any order and number. 8.5.1 Craft. You may activate sympathy tokens to craft a card from your hand. 8.5.2 Mobilize. Add a card from your hand to the Supporters stack. 8 8.5.3 Train. Spend a card whose suit matches the printed suit of a base on the map to place a warrior in the Officers box. This warrior is now an officer. 8.6 Evening Your Evening has two steps in the following order. 8.6.1 Military Operations. You may take actions, as follows, up to your number of officers, in any order and number. I Move. Take one move. II Battle. Initiate a battle. III Recruit. Place a warrior in any clearing with a base. IV Organize. Remove one Alliance warrior from an unsympathetic clearing, place a sympathy token there, and score the victory points listed on the space uncovered on your faction board. 8.6.2 Draw and Discard. Draw one card, plus one card per uncovered draw bonus. Then, if you have more than five cards in your hand, discard cards of your choice until you have five. 9. Vagabond V V 9.1 Overview The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves his relationship with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward him, he scores victory points. He can also complete quests to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage his pack of items, expanding his selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions. 9.2 Faction Rules and Abilities 9.2.1 Crafting. The Vagabond exhausts H to craft. All of his H match the suit of his current clearing. If the Vagabond crafts an item, he may immediately take it, face up. 9.2.2 Lone Wanderer. The Vagabond pawn is not a warrior (so he cannot rule a clearing or stop another player from ruling one). The Vagabond pawn cannot be removed from the map. I Full Removal. Whenever an enemy player uses an effect that says it removes all enemy pieces from a clearing (such as Alliance revolts, Favor of the Mice cards, Conspiracy bombs) with the Vagabond, the Vagabond damages three items. 9.2.3 Nimble. The Vagabond can move regardless of who rules his origin or destination clearing (4.2.1). 9.2.4 Defenseless. In battle, the Vagabond is defenseless (4.3.2.III) if he has no undamaged S. 9.2.5 Items. The Vagabond’s capabilities depend on the items he acquires. Instead of a Crafted Items box, he has a Satchel and various item tracks. Items on the Vagabond’s faction board can be face up or face down. The Vagabond exhausts face-up undamaged items, flipping them face down, to take many actions. I Item Tracks. When gained or flipped face up in the Satchel, T, X, and B are placed face up on their matching tracks. When flipped face down, T, X, or B on tracks are placed face down in the Satchel. Each track can only hold three matching items. II The Satchel. When gained, M, S, C, F, and H are placed face up in the Vagabond’s Satchel. 9.2.6 Maximum Rolled Hits. In battle, the Vagabond’s maximum rolled hits (4.3.2.I) equals his undamaged S, face up or face down, in his Satchel. 9.2.7 Taking Hits. Whenever the Vagabond takes a hit (4.3.3), he must damage one undamaged item, moving it to his Damaged box. If no undamaged items remain to damage, the Vagabond ignores any remaining hits. 9.2.8 Dominance Cards and Coalitions. The Vagabond cannot activate a dominance card for its normal victory condition (3.3.1). Instead, in games with four or more players, the Vagabond can activate a dominance card to form a coalition with another player, placing his score marker on that player’s faction board. (The Vagabond no longer scores points.) That player must have fewer victory points than each other player except the Vagabond forming the coalition, and that player cannot be in a coalition. If there is a tie for fewest victory points, he chooses one tied player. If the coalitioned player wins the game, the Vagabond also wins. 9.2.9 Relationships. Your faction board shows a Relationships chart, which has four spaces on the Allied track and one Hostile box. It holds a relationship marker for each non-Vagabond faction. I Improving Relationships. You can improve a relationship with a non-Hostile faction by taking the Aid action. a Cost. Aid a non-Hostile faction the number of times listed between their current Allied space and their next Allied space during the same turn. (A given Aid action counts toward only one improvement in relationship.)'

One generator could be high bandwidth, and receive many events to mix into its sequence, another generator could be high speed low bandwidth that periodically mixes with the high bandwidth generator. The high speed sequence would create a secondary sequence of data that an attacker would have to reverse. 4.7.3 Long Range Attacks Long range attacks involve acquiring old discarded client Private Keys, and generating a falsified ledger [10]. Proof of History provides some protection against long range attacks. A malicious user that gains access to old private keys would have to recreate a historical record that takes as much time as the original one they are trying to forge. This would require access to a faster processor than the network is currently using, otherwise the attacker would never catch up in history length. Additionally, a single source of time allows for construction of a simpler Proof of Replication (more on that in Section 6). Since the network is de- signed so that all participants in the network will rely on a single historical record of events. PoRep and PoH together should provide a defense of both space and time against a forged ledger. 5 Proof of Stake Consensus 5.1 Description This specific instance of Proof of Stake is designed for quick confirmation of the current sequence produced by the Proof of History generator, for voting and selecting the next Proof of History generator, and for punishing any mis- behaving validators. This algorithm depends on messages eventually arriving to all participating nodes within a certain timeout. 14 5.2 Terminology bonds Bonds are equivalent to a capital expense in Proof of Work. A miner buys hardware and electricity, and commits it to a single branch in a Proof of Work blockchain. A bond is coin that the validator commits as collateral while they are validating transactions. slashing The proposed solution to the nothing at stake problem in Proof of Stake systems [7]. When a proof of voting for a different branch is published, that branch can destroy the validators bond. This is an economic incentive designed to discourage validators from confirming multiple branches. super majority A super majority is 2 3 rds of the validators weighted by their bonds. A super majority vote indicates that the network has reached consensus, and at least 1 3 rd of the network would have had to vote maliciously for this branch to be invalid. This would put the economic cost of an attack at 1 3 rd of the market cap of the coin. 5.3 Bonding A bonding transaction takes a amount of coin and moves it to a bonding account under the users identity. Coins in the bonding account cannot be spent and have to remain in the account until the user removes them. The user can only remove stale coins that have timed out. Bonds are valid after super majority of the current stakeholders have confirmed the sequence. 5.4 Voting It is anticipated that the Proof of History generator will be able to publish a signature of the state at a predefined period. Each bonded identity must confirm that signature by publishing their own signed signature of the state. The vote is a simple yes vote, without a no. If super majority of the bonded identities have voted within a timeout, then this branch would be accepted as valid. 15'
