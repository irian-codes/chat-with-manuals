# Chat with Manuals (R&D version)

This repository contains the **research and development (R&D)** version of the app. It includes:
- Early drafts of the app.
- Experimental messy commits.
- Proof-of-concept implementations.
- Unrelated history to the `main` branch. It is an entirely different project from a code perspective.

### Branches
- **`research`**: This branch in this repository. This branch preserves the full history of the app's early development so you can see this project has had a period of experimentation and research that goes way back from the first commit of the final app. It is here to preserve this history and also I may use it in the future to quickly test new assumptions.
- **Other branches**: Cannot be merged with this branch, ever.

If you ended in this branch but you're looking for the polished, final version of the app, please go to the [`main`](https://github.com/irian-codes/chat-with-manuals/tree/main) branch.
